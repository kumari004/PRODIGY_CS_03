# PRODIGY_CS_03
This is the third task I was given during the internship at Prodigy InfoTech. It is the source code of the program in python which provides feedback about the password complexity to users.

Welcome to the Password Complexity Checker repository! This project is designed to help users assess the strength of their passwords. The tool evaluates a password's strength based on several criteria including length, the presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. It provides immediate feedback to users on how strong their password is and suggests improvements if necessary.

Features
Password Length Check: Ensures the password meets a minimum length requirement.
Uppercase and Lowercase Letters: Checks for the presence of both uppercase and lowercase letters.
Numbers: Validates the inclusion of numerical digits.
Special Characters: Verifies the presence of special characters (e.g., !, @, #, $).
Strength Indicator: Provides a visual indicator of password strength (e.g., weak, moderate, strong).
User Feedback: Offers suggestions to improve password strength based on the missing criteria.
